# Example Node Remote Control

[![Import](https://cdn.infobeamer.com/s/img/import.png)](https://info-beamer.com/use?url=https://github.com/info-beamer/package-control-example.git)

This package demonstrates the `control_ui` feature of info-beamer hosted. It allows each
node of your package to provide a custom HTML/JS/CSS interface. This interface is then
securely embedded into the device package of devices showing that package.

This allows you to create packages that can by controlled at runtime through the
click of (for example) a button.

for more information.
